                During the East India Company period, the civil services were
                classified into three –{" "}
              </b>{" "}
              covenanted, uncovenanted and special civil services. The
              covenanted civil service, or the Honourable East India Company's
              Civil Service (HEICCS), as it was called, largely comprised civil
              servants occupying the senior posts in the government. The
              uncovenanted civil service was introduced solely to facilitate the
              entry of Indians onto the lower rung of the administration. The
              special service comprised specialised departments, such as the
              Indian Forest Service, the Imperial Police and the Indian
              Political Department, whose ranks were drawn from either the
              covenanted civil service or the Indian Army. The Imperial Police
              included many Indian Army officers among its members, although
              after 1893 an annual exam was used to select its officers.In 1858
              the HEICCS was replaced by the Indian Civil Service (ICS), which
              became the highest civil service in India between 1858 and 1947.
              The last appointments to the ICS were made in 1942. With the
              passing of the Government of India Act 1919 by the Parliament of
              the United Kingdom, the Indian civil services—under the general
              oversight of the Secretary of State for India—were split into two
              arms, the All India Services and the Central Services. The Indian
              Civil Service was one of the ten All India Services.
